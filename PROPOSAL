We propose to add the notion of users and user permissions within our file system. The steps we will take to achieve these aims are listed below:

 - create two files: users (stores usernames and permissions) and filePerms (associates permissions to files)
 - create a login/chuser program which allows the user space to identify the current user, or the user to login to another user
 - redefine execv to accept and pass permissions
 - make init.cc exec to this login function to initialize the admin's permissions
 - modify the shell to be aware of its current user
 - modify ls and cat to handle permissions appropriately

Let us know if you have any suggestions.
